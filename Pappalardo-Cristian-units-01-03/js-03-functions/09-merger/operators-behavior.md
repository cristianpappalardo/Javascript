In javascript operators have different behavior based on the type of the operand they are working on, for example the '+' operator behaves differently if it is working on numbers or strings. If either operand is a string, + becomes string concatenation. Otherwise, it performs numeric addition. This is because the interpreter checks the types of the two operands before proceding, and based on the result it behaves a certain way.
